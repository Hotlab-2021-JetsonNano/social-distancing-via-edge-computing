# Social-Distancing Monitoring and Tracking on AI Platform via Edge-Computing
This is a project which implement high-quality social-distancing monitoring system on NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Jetson Xavier.  
This allows real-time human tracking on the video(or webcam), categorizing person as 'definite risk' if he/she exceeds a 'threshold time' we set.
The purpose of this project is to distribute croweded area by visualizing safety level on every region.
  
## Key features
### Model 
<img src="demo/table-runtime-analysis.jpg" width="60%" height="60%"></img><br/>  
The runtime on the table above is evaluated with 640 pixel demo video.
Among these models, YOLOv4-tiny-3L showed the best balance between AP and FPS.
  
### TensorRT
(to be updated soon)

### Transfer Learning
Since the model only has to detect human, we did transfer learning of YOLOv4-tiny-3L with crowd-human dataset.  
AP of the model improved.

## Usage
```script  
  ## Main-thread(Algorithm, Web framework) & Child-thread(Model)
  $ python3 server_async.py

  ## Main-thread(Web framework) & Child-thread(Model, Algorithm)
  $ python3 server_async2.py
```
  
## Environment
* Platform: NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit 4GB, NVIDIA Jetson Xavier (full-name needed)
* Camera : Logitech C270 webcam
* Libraries: TensorRT, OpenCV, NumPy, PyCUDA, etc. (version needed)
